This app is created for a scouting organization. It helps troop leaders to keep track of expenses they make during their camps or other events. 

Users can enter invoices' data like number, amount, category, etc. 
On the summary screen, they can look up how much money they can spend on this camp.

On completion of the event, the users can export entered data to a CSV file they can send to their cloud or email. The generated table is ready to paste into an Excel file, where the troop leaders have to enter all received payments and expenses.
